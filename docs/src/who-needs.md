## Have you ever got those thoughts below?

- Oh my precious model, I want you have an API with just `abbracadabra`.
- I have a lot of customized codes written by myself, I always have to spend a lot of time deploying these model on public platforms.
- I don't want to use those complicated tools, which requires docker, even kubernetes, etc. It becomes harder to debug.
- I don't want to spend lots of time learning the fancy tools on `AWS`, `Google Cloud`, etc.
- And it is so fxxking hard to deploy it correctly on those big platforms and even harder to debug.
- Instead of using those model serving modules on those platform, I think serving a model should be as simple as serving a flask/fast api app.
- WTF, can't I just simply get my model served?

- tries to provide the simplest way to serve your models
- standard and fully functioning API with automatic API documentation
- is intuitive, straight forward, transparent... Ok, any more similar words come to my mind later, I'll add them here.
- stays in python, stays in your virtual environment. Where you train your model, where you can serve and test your model. No extra containers, no extra hard-to-learn tools.
- helps you package your service and run it elsewhere
